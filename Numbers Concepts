1).arithmetic progression:  2,5,8,11,14,…
​
     n-th term =a+(n−1)d. ---> The n-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by

a is the first term.
d is the common difference between terms.

    S= n*[2a+(n−1)d]/2   --->  calculate sum of the arithmetic progression.

Here's a breakdown of the formula:
n is the number of terms.
a is the first term.
d is the common difference between terms.

2).Find n-th term of series 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21
      The series you've given seems to be an arithmetic series where each term is the sum of consecutive natural numbers.  

       n-th term = N * (N + 1) / 2   --->  The n-th term of this series can be found using the formula:

3).Formula for Sum of squares of n natural numbers: [n(n+1)(2n+1)] / 6

4).Formula for Sum of squares of first n even numbers: [2n(n + 1)(2n + 1)] / 3

5).Formula for Sum of squares of first n odd numbers: [n(2n+1)(2n-1)] / 3

6).Formula for sum of n odd numbers: n^2

7).Formula for sum of n even numbers: n(n+1)

8).Formula to calculate the number of diagonals in an N-sided convex polygon : N * (N - 3) / 2;

9).Simple Interest = (P × R × T)/100.

10).sum of a geometric progression: a*((r^n-1)/(r-1))
          a is the first term,
          r is the common ratio, and
          n is the number of terms.

11).Left Shift (<<):
          result = value * (2^numPositions)  --> This formula indicates that left-shifting value by numPositions is 
                                                       equivalent to multiplying value by 2 raised to the power of numPositions.

12).Signed Right Shift (>>):
          result = value / (2^numPositions)  -->  The signed right shift is similar to dividing value by 2 raised to the power of numPositions. 
                                                            The result is rounded down for integer types.

13).Unsigned Right Shift (>>>):
          result = (value / (2^numPositions)) mod (2^(bitLength - numPositions))  --> The unsigned right shift is similar to dividing value by 2 raised to the power of numPositions, 
                                                                                          and then taking the remainder when divided by 2 raised to the power of the remaining bit positions.
                                                                                               bitLength is the total number of bits in the data type.

14). Formula to calculate the minumun operation needed to empty the number (only use 3 and 2)  : 2x + 3y = n   -->   (n+2)/3   -->   (minimum operation)   

15).The Josephus problem is a theoretical problem related to a certain elimination game. 
          In this problem, people are standing in a circle, and every "k"-th person is eliminated until only one person remains.
               winner = ( winner + k) % i     --> Iterate from i=2 to i=n. This corresponds to the number of people in the circle.
