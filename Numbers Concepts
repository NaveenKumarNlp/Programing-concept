1).arithmetic progression:  2,5,8,11,14,…
​
     n-th term =a+(n−1)d. ---> The n-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by

a is the first term.
d is the common difference between terms.

    S= n*[2a+(n−1)d]/2   --->  calculate sum of the arithmetic progression.

Here's a breakdown of the formula:
n is the number of terms.
a is the first term.
d is the common difference between terms.

2).Find n-th term of series 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21
      The series you've given seems to be an arithmetic series where each term is the sum of consecutive natural numbers.  

       n-th term = N * (N + 1) / 2   --->  The n-th term of this series can be found using the formula:
